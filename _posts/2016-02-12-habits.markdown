As we grow out of childhood, our day-to-day, even hour-to-hour actions become increasingly dominated by our habits.

The food we eat, what we listen to on our commute to work, how we greet the cashier at the supermarket, the people we choose to associate with - these are all habits.

We do these things automatically, without thinking, and they have a profound impact on our lives.

It's worth however much effort it takes to develop habits that work for us, and not against us.
