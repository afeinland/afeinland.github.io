I have it really good right now, and for that I am tremendously grateful. All living costs are provided for me,
no cubicle to sit in all day, etc. Yet I don't take full advantage of my situation. Hours a week are squandered on things
that don't contribute towards my overall goal. And therein lies the problem: I have not defined me overall goal, my greater purpose.
