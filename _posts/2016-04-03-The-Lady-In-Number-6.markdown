* Everyone is interesting.

* Calmness is strength.

* Every day, life is beautiful. You can speak about anything - it's beautiful. Even the bad is beautiful if you know where to look - it has to be.

* Put as much as you can into your head because that's something nobody can take from you.

* It depends on me whether life is good or not. Not on life, on me. Everything is good or bad. I look at the good side.

* Don't just take life for granted.

* You can't achieve anything without work. When you love something, work and work and work and work.

* Never hate. Hatred only breeds more hatred.
